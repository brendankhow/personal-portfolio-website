            "Brendan is a friendly and self-motivated individual who has shown competency in handling Business-as-usual (BAU) tasks and is a valuable team player. During the internship, Brendan has shown himself to be a proactive and fast learner. He has shown great responsibility towards the tasks assigned to him. His ability to apply his technical knowledge and skills into real-life scenarios was evident in his work. He played a significant role in developing projects using data analytics tools such as Excel, Excel VBA and Refinitiv Eikon that are most useful for our analysts. We have observed Brendan's keen interest in understanding information systems through his active involvement in handling data for our BAU tasks. Moreover, he was able to quickly adapt to additional tasks that were assigned to him. I have no hesitation in recommending him to any organization for his future employment, with the full confidence that he will achieve his full potential and will be a valuable asset to the organization that he joins."
